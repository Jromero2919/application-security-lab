The code is then executed, potentially granting the user system access to export sensitive data, to install malware, or even to move laterally and to exploit other systems in the trusted internal network environment. While code injection attacks can take place in several ways, the common factor is allowing the user to submit executable code to the application. The most common forms of code injection are SQL injection (server side) and cross-site scripting (XSS) (client side).\n\n## Best practices for prevention\n- Never trust user input. Assume any input may transmit harmful values.\n- Apply least privilege principle (for example, limit users to read only wherever possible).\n- Avoid passing raw user input directly to functions; use parameterized queries to extract data first.\n- Sanitize user input strings of special characters such as ?, &, /, <, >, and quotation marks.\n- Use whitelisting of known good values.\n- Validate user input against expected response types.\n- Escape shell commands with functions such as shlex for Python, or escapeshellarg for PHP.\n- Remember that code injection can take place on multiple fronts: GET and POST requests, but also cookies and HTTP headers.\n- Ensure up-to-date patching across all systems to remediate known vulnerabilities so these cannot be exploited by code injection.\n- Educate all team members on safe data handling procedures to prevent attacks.","text": ""},"properties": {"tags": ["javascript","CodeInjection","Security","SourceServer","SourceHttpBody","Taint"],"categories": ["Security"],"exampleCommitFixes": [{"commitURL": "https://github.com/lvn/botstrap/commit/aafeaca53e8d89eb950d8e9c3af8874dc90686ec?diff=split#diff-e727e4bdf3657fd1d798edcd6b099d6e092f8573cba266154583a746bba0f346L-1","lines": [{"line": "var config = require(configFile);\n","lineNumber": 17,"lineChange": "removed"},{"line": "var config = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync(configFile));\n","lineNumber": 17,"lineChange": "added"}]},{"commitURL": "https://github.com/noppa/ng-hot-reload/commit/5de61299a0a7aa602fe015ac9f2ff3af3f798348?diff=split#diff-8f9d1530fa118465c523a517c5f4cac4ec173f17b820514034dc39e588415f63L-1","lines": [{"line": "var update = event.data;\r\n","lineNumber": 4,"lineChange": "removed"},{"line": "new Function(update)();\r\n","lineNumber": 5,"lineChange": "removed"},{"line": "var data = event.data ?

This type of attack is highly preventable by following best practices when setting sensitive session cookies.\n\n## Best practices for prevention\n* Set the `secure` attribute in the response header when setting cookies on the client side, and use a test tool to verify that secure cookie transmission is in place.\n* Always use HTTPS for all login pages and never redirect from HTTP to HTTPS, which leaves secure session data open to interception.\n* Follow other best practices when it comes to session cookies, such as setting the HttpOnly flag and maintaining highly time-limited sessions.\n* Consider implementing browser checks and providing secure data only within a browser that supports tight cookie security.\n* Generate session IDs in a way that is not easily predictable, invalidate sessions upon logout, and never reuse session IDs.\n* Educate developers to use built-in secure session-management functionality within the development environment instead of taking a DIY approach.","text": ""},"properties": {"tags": ["javascript","WebCookieSecureDisabledByDefault","Security"],"categories": ["Security"],"exampleCommitFixes": [{"commitURL": "https://github.com/cmilfont/biohacking/commit/d034909675024ef5cbdee75e2ec14e7a89caa1f4?diff=split#diff-a4c65ede64197e1a112899a68bf994485b889c4b143198bac4af53425b38406fL-1","lines": [{"line": "cookie: {\n","lineNumber": 32,"lineChange": "none"},{"line": "  maxAge: 60000,\n","lineNumber": 33,"lineChange": "none"},{"line": "  domain,\n","lineNumber": 34,"lineChange": "none"},{"line": "  secure: true,\n","lineNumber": 35,"lineChange": "added"}]},{"commitURL": "https://github.com/sahava/GoogleTagManagerTemplates_site/commit/d61e1e054c79a7a6da38869819d6fa3a27fc48a0?diff=split#diff-5518f6a4122fcd2aee3d829253b3f89262461ec1d5127af437853ae173862043L-1","lines": [{"line": "  try {\n","lineNumber": 5,"lineChange": "none"},{"line": "    const idToken = req.body.idToken.toString();\n","lineNumber": 6,"lineChange": "none"},{"line": "\n","lineNumber": 7,"lineChange": "none"},{"line": "    // Set session cookie settings\n","lineNumber": 8,"lineChange": "none"},{"line": "    const expiresIn = 1000 * 60 * 60 * 24 * 5;\n","lineNumber": 9,"lineChange": "none"},{"line": "    const options = {maxAge: expiresIn, httpOnly: true};\n","lineNumber": 10,"lineChange": "removed"},{"line": "    const options = {maxAge: expiresIn, httpOnly: true, secure: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production'};\n","lineNumber": 10,"lineChange": "added"},{"line": "\n","lineNumber": 11,"lineChange": "none"},{"line": "    const sessionCookie = await app.auth().createSessionCookie(idToken, {expiresIn});\n","lineNumber": 12,"lineChange": "none"},{"line": "\n","lineNumber": 13,"lineChange": "none"},{"line": "    res.cookie('session', sessionCookie, options);\n","lineNumber": 14,"lineChange": "none"}]},{"commitURL": "https://github.com/mike-goodwin/owasp-threat-dragon/commit/9bb8e8ca86c152c32e3070994c34d3e1923d7d2a?diff=split#diff-ae9b91456b11c181adfefe3d9f1966931be9926c98a4ed0390ef82cf38be6fe9L-1","lines": [{"line": "res.cookie('XSRF-TOKEN', req.csrfToken(), { httpOnly: false });\n","lineNumber": 7,"lineChange": "removed"},{"line": "var cookieOptions = { httpOnly: false };\n","lineNumber": 9,"lineChange": "added"},{"line": "\n","lineNumber": 10,"lineChange": "added"},{"line": "if(process.env.NODE_ENV != 'development' && process.env.NODE_ENV) {\n","lineNumber": 11,"lineChange": "added"},{"line": "    cookieOptions.secure = true;\n","lineNumber": 12,"lineChange": "added"},{"line": "} else {\n","lineNumber": 13,"lineChange": "added"},{"line": "    require('../config/loggers.config').logger.error({security: true}, 'secure anti-XSRF cookie flag was false - should only happen in dev environments');\n","lineNumber": 14,"lineChange": "added"},{"line": "}\n","lineNumber": 15,"lineChange": "added"},{"line": "\n","lineNumber": 16,"lineChange": "added"},{"line": "res.cookie('XSRF-TOKEN', req.csrfToken(), cookieOptions);\n","lineNumber": 17,"lineChange": "added"}]}],"exampleCommitDescriptions": [],"precision": "very-high","repoDatasetSize": 50,"cwe": ["CWE-614"]}},{"id": "javascript/reDOSPolynomial","name": "reDOSPolynomial","shortDescription": {"text": "Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)"},"defaultConfiguration": {"level": "error"},"help": {"markdown": "## Details\n\nDenial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at making a system inaccessible to its original and legitimate users. There are many types of DoS attacks, ranging from trying to clog the network pipes to the system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines (a Distributed Denial of Service - DDoS - attack) to sending crafted requests that cause a system to crash or take a disproportional amount of time to process.\n\nThe Regular expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) is a type of Denial of Service attack. Regular expressions are incredibly powerful, but they aren't very intuitive and can ultimately end up making it easy for attackers to take your site down.\n\nLet's take the following regular expression as an example:\n```js\nregex = /A(B|C+)+D/\n```\n\nThis regular expression accomplishes the following:\n- `A` The string must start with the letter 'A'\n- `(B|C+)+` The string must then follow the letter A with either the letter 'B' or some number of occurrences of the letter 'C' (the `+` matches one or more times). The `+` at the end of this section states that we can look for one or more matches of this section.\n- `D` Finally, we ensure this section of the string ends with a 'D'\n\nThe expression would match inputs such as `ABBD`, `ABCCCCD`, `ABCBCCCD` and `ACCCCCD`\n\nIt most cases, it doesn't take very long for a regex engine to find a match:\n\n```bash\n$ time node -e '/A(B|C+)+D/.test(\"ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCD\")'\n0.04s user 0.01s system 95% cpu 0.052 total\n\n$ time node -e '/A(B|C+)+D/.test(\"ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCX\")'\n1.79s user 0.02s system 99% cpu 1.812 total\n```\n\nThe entire process of testing it against a 30 characters long string takes around ~52ms. But when given an invalid string, it takes nearly two seconds to complete the test, over ten times as long as it took to test a valid string. The dramatic difference is due to the way regular expressions get evaluated.\n\nMost Regex engines will work very similarly (with minor differences). The engine will match the first possible way to accept the current character and proceed to the next one. If it then fails to match the next one, it will backtrack and see if there was another way to digest the previous character. If it goes too far down the rabbit hole only to find out the string doesn't match in the end, and if many characters have multiple valid regex paths, the number of backtracking steps can become very large, resulting in what is known as _catastrophic backtracking_.\n\nLet's look at how our expression runs into this problem, using a shorter string: \"ACCCX\". While it seems fairly straightforward, there are still four different ways that the engine could match those three C's:\n1. CCC\n2. CC+C\n3. C+CC\n4. C+C+C.\n\nThe engine has to try each of those combinations to see if any of them potentially match against the expression. When you combine that with the other steps the engine must take, we can use [RegEx 101 debugger](https://regex101.com/debugger) to see the engine has to take a total of 38 steps before it can determine the string doesn't match.\n\nFrom there, the number of steps the engine must use to validate a string just continues to grow.\n\n| String | Number of C's | Number of steps |\n| -------|-------------:| -----:|\n| ACCCX | 3 | 38\n| ACCCCX | 4 | 71\n| ACCCCCX | 5 | 136\n| ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCX | 14 | 65,553\n\n\nBy the time the string includes 14 C's, the engine has to take over 65,000 steps just to see if the string is valid. These extreme situations can cause them to work very slowly (exponentially related to input size, as shown above), allowing an attacker to exploit this and can cause the service to excessively consume CPU, resulting in a Denial of Service.","text": ""},"properties": {"tags": ["javascript","reDOSPolynomial","Security","SourceServer","SourceHttpBody"],"categories": ["Security"],"exampleCommitFixes": [],"exampleCommitDescriptions": [],"precision": "very-high","repoDatasetSize": 0,"cwe": ["CWE-400"]}},{"id": "javascript/HardcodedNonCryptoSecret","name": "HardcodedNonCryptoSecret","shortDescription": {"text": "Hardcoded Non-Cryptographic Secret"},"defaultConfiguration": {"level": "error"},"help": {"markdown": "## Details\n\nWhen constants are hardcoded into applications, this information could easily be reverse-engineered and become known to attackers.

If the password is reused across different environments or applications, the compromise can spread quickly and broadly.\n\n## Best practices for prevention\n* Plan software architecture such that keys and passwords are always stored outside the code, wherever possible.\n* Plan encryption into software architecture for all credential information and ensure proper handling of keys, credentials, and passwords.\n* Prompt for a secure password on first login rather than hard-code a default password.\n* If a hardcoded password or credential must be used, limit its use, for example, to system console users rather than via the network.\n* Use strong hashes for inbound password authentication, ideally with randomly assigned salts to increase the difficulty level in case of brute-force attack.","text": ""},"properties": {"tags": ["javascript","NoHardcodedPasswords","Security","InTest"],"categories": ["Security","InTest"],"exampleCommitFixes": [{"commitURL": "https://github.com/UsabilityDynamics/node-rabbit-client/commit/bf652950ac5eb1cd85ebe349b29ad045df51dd07?diff=split#diff-506a1dcb4e0d34ef96430d0fa0790cc3e84cbf193ea91b3e49e5e52c86dad0f4L-1","lines": [{"line": "login        : 'udx',\n","lineNumber": 5,"lineChange": "removed"},{"line": "password     : 'ISM0Rules'\n","lineNumber": 6,"lineChange": "removed"},{"line": "login        : process.env.RABBIT_LOGIN,\n","lineNumber": 5,"lineChange": "added"},{"line": "password     : process.env.RABBIT_PASSWORD\n","lineNumber": 6,"lineChange": "added"}]},{"commitURL": "https://github.com/perborgen/data_hub/commit/8de6d9c7efdc6d0a773808c872c83f3374643a8e?diff=split#diff-58417e0f781b6656949d37258c8b9052ed266e2eb7a5163cad7b0863e6b2916aL-1","lines": [{"line": "var config  = require('./config');\n","lineNumber": 2,"lineChange": "none"},{"line": "var handler = require('./api/handler');\n","lineNumber": 3,"lineChange": "none"},{"line": "var inert   = require('inert');\n","lineNumber": 4,"lineChange": "none"},{"line": "var bell    = require('bell');\n","lineNumber": 5,"lineChange": "none"},{"line": "var hapiAC  = require('hapi-auth-cookie');\n","lineNumber": 6,"lineChange": "none"},{"line": "\n","lineNumber": 7,"lineChange": "none"},{"line": "server.connection({\n","lineNumber": 8,"lineChange": "none"},{"line": "    port: process.env.PORT || 8080,\n","lineNumber": 9,"lineChange": "none"},{"line": "    host: \"0.0.0.0\" || \"localhost\"\n","lineNumber": 10,"lineChange": "none"},{"line": "});\n","lineNumber": 11,"lineChange": "none"},{"line": "\n","lineNumber": 12,"lineChange": "none"},{"line": "server.register([inert, bell, hapiAC], function(err){\n","lineNumber": 13,"lineChange": "none"},{"line": "\n","lineNumber": 14,"lineChange": "none"},{"line": "    if (err) {\n","lineNumber": 15,"lineChange": "none"},{"line": "        throw err;\n","lineNumber": 16,"lineChange": "none"},{"line": "    }\n","lineNumber": 17,"lineChange": "none"},{"line": "\n","lineNumber": 18,"lineChange": "none"},{"line": "    var authCookieOptions = {\n","lineNumber": 19,"lineChange": "none"},{"line": "        password: 'cookie-encryption-password', //Password used for encryption\n","lineNumber": 20,"lineChange": "removed"},{"line": "        cookie: 'sitepoint-auth', // Name of cookie to set\n","lineNumber": 21,"lineChange": "removed"},{"line": "        password: config.password || process.env.PASSWORD, //Password used for encryption\n","lineNumber": 20,"lineChange": "added"},{"line": "        cookie: 'auth', // Name of cookie to set\n","lineNumber": 21,"lineChange": "added"}]},{"commitURL": "https://github.com/Gitualize/Gitualize/commit/f6de5689d637dc41abd4b43eea40371fd1088d33?diff=split#diff-273ae97b30b3f18c1d3fc9bf418b55be30c6e4a19f3f51953362cfa762980c63L-1","lines": [{"line": "user: 'docker',\n","lineNumber": 2,"lineChange": "removed"},{"line": "password: 'docker',\n","lineNumber": 3,"lineChange": "removed"},{"line": "database: 'docker',\n","lineNumber": 4,"lineChange": "removed"},{"line": "user: process.env.DATABASE_USER,\n","lineNumber": 2,"lineChange": "added"},{"line": "password: process.env.DATABASE_PASSWORD,\n","lineNumber": 3,"lineChange": "added"},{"line": "database: process.env.DATABASE_NAME,\n","lineNumber": 4,"lineChange": "added"}]}],"exampleCommitDescriptions": [],"precision": "very-high","repoDatasetSize": 44,"cwe": ["CWE-798","CWE-259"]}},{"id": "javascript/NoRateLimitingForExpensiveWebOperation","name": "NoRateLimitingForExpensiveWebOperation","shortDescription": {"text": "Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling"},"defaultConfiguration": {"level": "warning"},"help": {"markdown": "\n## Details\n\nWithout unlimited resources, software operating in the real world is inherently limited in the resources it may consume; similarly, servers are limited by the number of simultaneous sessions they can handle.

Software with this weakness does not include such limitations and as a result, individual user sessions may consume too many resources, leading to unintended software behavior including, potentially, denial of service.

In general, URL redirection refers to the ability of a website or application to redirect users to another site. This is often a benign and useful feature. For example, if a resource has moved to a new location, URL redirection can transfer the user to that location rather than displaying an error message.\nHowever, this ability can be exploited through social engineering, tricking the user into believing they are accessing one site when, in reality, they are being redirected to a dangerous site, such as a phishing site.

The browser unknowingly executes malicious script on the client side (through client-side languages; usually JavaScript or HTML)  in order to perform actions that are otherwise typically blocked by the browser's Same Origin Policy.\n\nInjecting malicious code is the most prevalent manner by which XSS is exploited; for this reason, escaping characters in order to prevent this manipulation is the top method for securing code against this vulnerability.\n\nEscaping means that the application is coded to mark key characters, and particularly key characters included in user input, to prevent those characters from being interpreted in a dangerous context. For example, in HTML, `<` can be coded as  `&lt`; and `>` can be coded as `&gt`; in order to be interpreted and displayed as themselves in text, while within the code itself, they are used for HTML tags. If malicious content is injected into an application that escapes special characters and that malicious content uses `<` and `>` as HTML tags, those characters are nonetheless not interpreted as HTML tags by the browser if they've been correctly escaped in the application code and in this way the attempted attack is diverted.\n\nThe most prominent use of XSS is to steal cookies (source: OWASP HttpOnly) and hijack user sessions, but XSS exploits have been used to expose sensitive information, enable access to privileged services and functionality and deliver malware.\n\n### Types of attacks\nThere are a few methods by which XSS can be manipulated:\n\n|Type|Origin|Description|\n|--|--|--|\n|**Stored**|Server|The malicious code is inserted in the application (usually as a link) by the attacker. The code is activated every time a user clicks the link.|\n|**Reflected**|Server|The attacker delivers a malicious link externally from the vulnerable web site application to a user. When clicked, malicious code is sent to the vulnerable web site, which reflects the attack back to the user's browser.|\n|**DOM-based**|Client|The attacker forces the user's browser to render a malicious page. The data in the page itself delivers the cross-site scripting data.|\n|**Mutated**| |The attacker injects code that appears safe, but is then rewritten and modified by the browser, while parsing the markup. An example is rebalancing unclosed quotation marks or even adding quotation marks to unquoted parameters.|\n\n### Affected environments\nThe following environments are susceptible to an XSS attack:\n\n* Web servers\n* Application servers\n* Web application environments\n\n## Best practices for prevention\nThis section describes the top best practices designed to specifically protect your code:\n\n* Sanitize data input in an HTTP request before reflecting it back, ensuring all data is validated, filtered or escaped before echoing anything back to the user, such as the values of query parameters during searches.\n* Convert special characters such as `?`, `&`, `/`, `<`, `>` and spaces to their respective HTML or URL encoded equivalents.\n* Give users the option to disable client-side scripts.\n* Redirect invalid requests.\n* Detect simultaneous logins, including those from two separate IP addresses, and invalidate those sessions.\n* Use and enforce a Content Security Policy (source: Wikipedia) to disable any features that might be manipulated for an XSS attack.\n* Read the documentation for any of the libraries referenced in your code to understand which elements allow for embedded HTML.","text": ""},"properties": {"tags": ["javascript","SemanticXss","Security"],"categories": ["Security"],"exampleCommitFixes": [],"exampleCommitDescriptions": [],"precision": "very-high","repoDatasetSize": 0,"cwe": ["CWE-79"]}}]}},"results": [{"ruleId": "javascript/CodeInjection","ruleIndex": 0,"level": "error","message": {"text":"Unsanitized input from the HTTP request body flows into eval, where it is executed as JavaScript code.
